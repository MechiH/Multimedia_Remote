Q4)
Because it's declared as virtual void methodMultimedia()=0 , this method is designated as abstract.
Because the class has become abstract, it is no longer feasible to instantiate the multimedia object. 

Q5)
Polymorphism is the key feature.
Display function must be declared as virtual in C++ multimedia classes.
Array contains pointers to objects. 
in C++ the array can also contain objects but in JAVA the array always contains pointers to objects.


Q6) 
A pointer to the array passed as argument is not enough; the array must be passed in the Film object using refrences.


Q7)
Because while creating the Film object we had an instance variable created with "new", so in the destructor of Film,
the instance variable "array" must be destroyed too.


Q8) 
Class groups that include objects must have destructors, so te delete these instance when  the group object is deleted
whereas if it just have pointers to the objects havaing a destructor is not mandatory. 

Q10)
We might add a pointer to a Table in the Multimedia class and check whether it is null
 to prevent an object from being created outside the table.
